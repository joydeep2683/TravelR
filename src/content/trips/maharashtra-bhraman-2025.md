# Between Highways and Hymns: A Sacred Journey Across Maharashtra  
*(25 Dec 2025 – 01 Jan 2026)*

Some journeys are planned on maps.  
Some are written by time, traffic, temple bells, and tired feet standing patiently in long queues.  

This was one such journey — where highways merged into holy paths, and devotion quietly walked alongside us.

---

## 25 December 2025 – The Journey Begins

The journey began quietly, before temples and tolls, with a **bus ride from Bangalore to Bombay**.  
**Expressline Paribahan Ltd.** — clean, punctual, dependable.

One thought lingered: *a slightly longer dinner stop would have made it perfect*.  
But perhaps journeys are meant to leave something unfinished — a reminder that comfort is never the destination.

---

## 26 December 2025 – Family, Faith & the Road to Trimbakeshwar

By afternoon, my parents arrived from **Kolkata**, landing in Bombay around **12:30 PM**.  
Without delay, we began our road journey towards **Trimbakeshwar**.

Crossing toll booths, refueling diesel tanks, and watching daylight fade — the road itself became a meditation.

### Travel Expenses (26 Dec)
- Airport parking – ₹270  
- Toll – ₹145  
- Diesel – ₹5000  
- Toll – ₹145  

We reached Trimbakeshwar around **8:30 PM**.  
Finding a hotel late at night was challenging, but **Ganga Nivas**, near Hotel Dhruv Palace, gave us shelter.

- Distance from temple: ~700 m  
- Auto charge to temple: ₹100 (fixed rate)

Sometimes, that’s all a pilgrim needs.

---

## 27 December 2025 – Waiting With God

At **4:00 AM**, we joined the darshan queue at **Trimbakeshwar Jyotirlinga**.

Six hours.  
No complaints.

Special darshan options exist, but I prefer the **normal line**.  
Because devotion is not about reaching God faster —  
it is about **walking slowly enough for your thoughts to catch up**.

Standing in line, watching people, listening to chants — the wait itself became worship.

---

## Panchavati – Where Stories Live

From Trimbakeshwar, we moved to **Panchavati, Nashik**.

Autos usually cover 11 places (₹500–700), but time allowed us only a few.

### Places Visited
- **Ramghat** – where the Kumbh Mela takes place  
- **Tapovan** – where Lakshmana cut Surpanakha’s nose (*Nashika → Nashik*)  
- **Kapila–Godavari Sangam** – just 100 m away  
- **Big Rama Statue** opposite Tapovan  
- **Kattya Maruti Temple** – Hanuman emerged from a thorn  
- **Kalaram Mandir**, **Sita Gufa**, Panchavati  

Here, mythology doesn’t feel old — it feels *present*.

---

## Muktidham – One Temple, Many Gods

**Muktidham Temple** houses all Hindu deities under one roof.

- 12 Jyotirlinga replicas  
- **Parli Vaijnath** is worshipped instead of Deoghar’s Vaidyanath  
- A reflection of Marathi spiritual tradition

Faith adapts gently to geography.

---

## Shirdi – Sai’s Gentle Order

By evening, we reached **Shirdi**.

- Hotel: **Bhagyalakshmi**  
- Price: ₹7000 → ₹6000  
- 4 people stayed in one room

Senior citizen darshan was smooth.  
One person accompanied each senior — I was with my father, my wife with my mother.

Free **Anna Prasadam** followed — tasty, filling, slightly unclean, but deeply heartfelt.

Sai Baba’s presence does not demand luxury — only surrender.

---

## 28 December 2025 – Ajanta: When Time Stands Still

Morning shopping and poha breakfast were followed by a sudden plan change.

> **Important Tip:**  
> - Ajanta is closed on Mondays  
> - Ellora is closed on Tuesdays  

Thanks to our driver sri Nitish ji for his promptness, we rushed to **Ajanta Caves**.

- Entry: ₹30/person  
- Shuttle bus:  
  - ₹15 (Non-AC)  
  - ₹25 (AC)  
- Distance from gate: ~4–5 km  

### Major Caves Covered
1, 2, 9, 10, 16, 17, 19, **26**

**Cave 26** stood out — reclining Buddha, calm prayer hall, quiet strength.

Ajanta wasn’t built for display.  
It was built for **meditation**.

---

## Ellora Stay – Imperfect Shelter

Stayed at **Omkar Guest House** (₹5000 for 2 nights).

- Water leakage from ceiling  
- Faulty wiring, electric shocks  
- Poor maintenance  

Staff behavior was good.  
Room was changed the next day.

Journeys test patience not only in temples, but in discomfort.

---

## 29 December 2025 – Ghrishneshwar & Ellora’s Grandeur

### Ghrishneshwar Jyotirlinga
- Darshan time: ~3.5 hours  

### Ellora Caves
- Entry: ₹40/person  

**Highlights**
- Cave 16 – Kailash Temple (rock-cut marvel)  
- Mahishasuramardini carving near temple entrance  
- Buddhist caves: 1–12  
- Hindu caves: 13–29  
- Jain caves (30–34) — missed due to distance  

E-vehicles stopped after 2 PM due to battery drain.  
We walked **2–3 km**. Jain caves would require **5–6 km**.

**Cave 12 (Teen Taal)** is still used by Buddhist students for meditation.

Ellora doesn’t impress — it overwhelms.

---

## 30 December 2025 – Shani & Bhimashankar

Started at **9:30 AM**.

### Shani Shingnapur
- Less crowd  
- Well maintained  
- Peaceful darshan  

Saw bulls used for crushing sugarcane — fresh juice, simple joy.

Reached **Bhimashankar** by night.

- Hotel: **Vanashankul** (₹2000)  
- Poor maintenance despite beautiful property  

Police restrictions and taxi union pressure prevented private vehicle access.  
Our car was stopped near Parking-3.

Faith continued. Frustration followed quietly.

---

## 31 December 2025 – Touching the Jyotirlinga

Reached darshan queue at **4:00 AM**.  
Completed by **6:00 AM**.

This was the **only Jyotirlinga** where we touched the linga and poured **Ganga jal** ourselves.

Opposite the entrance — **Parvati Mata**.

We left for Bombay at 10 AM.

### Evening in Mumbai
- Siddhivinayak Temple  
- Mahalaxmi Temple  
- Dinner at Bandra  
- Fireworks view from 6th floor  

Faith welcomed the New Year before celebration did.

---

## 01 January 2026 – Mumbai: Faith Meets Fame

Started Mumbai darshan at **12:15 PM**.

- Bought **bajri shankarapali** from Samant Brothers  
- Passed Ambani’s house — security beyond imagination  
- Gateway of India (too crowded to approach)  
- Taj Hotel view from afar  
- Colaba shopping  
- Marine Drive  
- Wankhede Stadium  
- Haji Ali Dargah  
- Bandstand  
- Mannat (SRK’s house)  
- Salman Khan’s residence  

Faith and fame coexist strangely in Mumbai — side by side, yet worlds apart.

The journey ended at the airport.

## Final Reflection

God is found  
- in long queues  
- in missed plans  
- in tired walks  
- in broken hotels  
- in shared beds  
- in simple food  
- in silent caves  

And sometimes, on highways —  
between toll booths and temple bells.

🙏
