# Magical Bali

Our journey began in the heart of Ubud. The spiritual center of Bali.

## The Rice Terraces
Walking through Tegalalang was breathtaking. The green layers stretched as far as the eye could see.

## Monkey Forest
We visited the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary. The monkeys were playful but we kept our distance as advised!

## Summary
A truly rejuvenating experience for everyone involved.
